**NewsHub** is a Flutter app that displays top and category-based news in **Arabic**, powered by [NewsData.io](https://newsdata.io/api).  
It features a modern **UI with gradients, splash animations, and smooth scrolling lists**, and lets you read full articles inside the app via **WebView**.  

This project was built as a **practice app** to explore **API integration, animations, gradient UI design, and scrollable layouts** in Flutter.
